      <p>
        This document proposes a mechanism by which an application <var>APP</var> can opt-in to
        exposing certain information with another application <var>CAPTR</var>, if
        <var>CAPTR</var> is screen-capturing the tab in which <var>APP</var> is running. It
        describes a mechanism for <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-browser">tab capture</a> only.

        <h3>Generic Problem Description</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a web-application, running in one tab, which we’ll name "<var>main_app</var>."
          Assume <var>main_app</var> calls
          <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>
          and the user chooses to share another tab, where an application is running which we’ll
          call "<var>captured_app</var>."
	  
        </p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><var>main_app</var> does not know what it is capturing.</li>
          <li>
            <var>captured_app</var> does not know that it is being captured; let alone by whom.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Both these traits are desirable for the general case, but there exist legitimate use cases
          where the browser would want to allow applications to opt-in to bridging that gap and
          enable a connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wish to enable the legitimate use cases while keeping the general case as it was
          before.

        <h3>Use-case #1: Driving Presentations from Video Conferencing Apps</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a collaborating presentation software and video-conferencing software. Assume the
          user is in a VC session. The user starts sharing a presentation. Both applications are
          interested in letting the VC app discover that it is capturing a slides session, which
          application, and even which session, so that the VC application will be able to expose
          controls to the user for flipping through slides. When the user clicks those controls, the
          VC app will be able to send messages to the presentation app, requesting that it do such
          things as flip through slides, enter/leave presentation-mode, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The means for transmitting these messages are outside the scope of this document. Some
          options are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shared cloud infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Messaging via a worker. (Note: Storage Partitioning might disrupt this option.)</li>
          <li>A rudimentary messaging API might be added expressly for this purpose.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="use-case-2">
        <h3>Use-case #2: Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Capturing applications often wish to gather statistics over what applications their users
          tend to capture. For example, VC applications would like to know how often their users
          share presentation applications from specific providers, Wikipedia, CNN, etc. Gathering
          such information can be used to improve service for the users by introducing new
          collaborations, such as the one described above.

        <h3>Use-case #3: Detecting Unintended Captures</h3>
        <p>
          Users sometimes choose to share the wrong tab. Sometimes they switch to sharing the wrong
          tab by clicking the share-this-tab-instead button by mistake. A benevolent application
          could try to protect the user by presenting an in-app dialog for re-confirmation, if they
          believe that the user may have made a mistake.

      <section id="use-case-4">
        <h3>Use-case #4: Avoiding "Hall of Mirrors"</h3>
        <p>
          This use-case is a sub-case of #3, but deserves its own section due to its importance. The
          "Hall of Mirrors" effect occurs when users choose to share the tab in which the VC call
          takes place. When detecting self-capture, a VC application can avoid displaying the
          captured stream back to the user, thereby avoiding the dreaded effect.

      <h2>The Capture-Handle Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The capture-handle mechanism consists of two main parts - one on the captured side, one on
        the capturing side.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#captured-side">Captured applications</a> opt-in to exposing information by

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#capturing-side">Capturing applications</a> read this information as
          {{CaptureHandle}}.

      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="captured-side">
      <h2>Captured Side</h2>
      <p>
        Applications are allowed to expose information to capturing applications. They would
        typically do so before knowing if they even are captured. The mechanism used is calling
        {{MediaDevices/setCaptureHandleConfig}} with an appropriate {{CaptureHandleConfig}}.

      <section id="capture-handle-config">
        <h3><dfn>CaptureHandleConfig</dfn></h3>
        <p>
          The CaptureHandleConfig dictionary is used to instruct the user agent what information the
          captured application intends to expose, and to which applications it is willing to expose
          said information.
